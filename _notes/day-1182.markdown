1. **The Treasury Department has ordered Trump's name to be printed on the IRS stimulus checks that are being sent out to tens of millions of Americans.** It will be the first time a president's name will appear on an IRS funding disbursement. Trump has privately asked Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to let him formally sign the checks, but the president is not an authorized signer for legal disbursements by the U.S. Treasury. The unprecedented decision to add Trump's name to the checks could slow their delivery by at least a few days, according to a senior IRS official, although other officials disputed that the checks would be delayed.
