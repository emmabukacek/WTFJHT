- Contributing a copyedit

So, how can you contribute?


### Copyediting

Someone's gotta catch spelling mistakes and other shit ~before~ after it hits the press, right?
Well, I'm glad it's you! 💪

#### Before Submitting A Copyedit

If you haven't already, start by making a Github account.
[You can do that here.][github-signup]

A Github account allows you to interact with Github repositories (Such as this one!)
by submitting issues, commenting, and of course, submitting pull requests.

If you want a primer on how Github, or it's underlying technology "git" works,
[How-To Geek has a good primer.][how-to-geek-article]

#### How To Submit A Copyedit

Once you have a Github account, the next part is cake. 🎂
The easiest way to contribute to WTFJHT is [through our website.][wtfjht-website]

1. Navigate to the article you would like to edit and click on "Improve this
   article."

   > Add link to image here ![]()

1. Next, Github will prompt you to fork this repository. Click on "Fork this
   repository" to proceed. You will only need to do this once.

   > If you want to read more on how to write a good commit message, a good
   > article outlining some good starting points [can be found here.][commit-message-article]

   > Add link to image here ![]()

1. At this point, your changes are ready to go! At this point, we need to create
   what's called a "pull requests" in Github. In simplest terms, this allows you
   to propose your changes in a format that we can review prior to accepting
   your change. If you would like to know more, you can [read more

   > Pro tip: Adding animated gifs to your pull requests gives you cool points. 💯
   > You can do this by adding ![Alternate Text](https://website.com/link-to-gif.gif)

1. Good job, friend! 🙋‍♀️ Now, we wait. Once a repository maintainer
   approves your work, they will merge in your changes! We may have questions
   for you, so check in with your pull request by clicking on the "Pull
   Requests" tab in the project repository. Github will send notification emails
   as things change by default, as well.
